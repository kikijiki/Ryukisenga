# RYUKISENGA (流輝線画)

## Description

Ryukisenga is an android live wallpaper. SVG files present in the gallery or on the sd-card are parsed and converted to lines. These lines are rendered progressively as they flow in place from outside the screen, or from the touch location. There is also a style editor to customize the way the lines are drawn.
